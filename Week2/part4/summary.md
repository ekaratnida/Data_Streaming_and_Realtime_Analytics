# Summary

Congratulations! You have completed this Introduction to Kafka workshop.

## Wrapping up

We have now built an end-to-end streaming pipeline. We have data flowing into Kafka from an external system and are doing real time processing on it.

We have also used the Kafka tooling to explore Kafka's main concepts that are key to building reliable, scalable, and performant environments.

In this workshop, you:

- Configured the Kafka command line tools
- Created, listed, and described topics using the `kafka-topics.sh` tool
- Consumed records with the `kafka-console-consumer.sh` tool
- Produced records with the `kafka-console-producer.sh` tool
- Used the `kafka-consumer-group.sh` tool to describe consumer groups
- Configured and ran the Kafka Connect runtime in distributed mode
- Configured and ran the `FileStreamsSourceConnector`
- Ran a Kafka Streams application
